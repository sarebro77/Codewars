// Reverse Factorials

// I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

// For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

// Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

// Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).
// Examples

//     120 will return "5!"
//     24 will return "4!"
//     150 will return "None"

// Problem
function reverseFactorial(num) {
	// happy coding!
}

// Solution
function reverseFactorial(num) {
	let product = 1,
		n = 1;

	while (product <= num) {
		if (product === num) return `${n}!`;
		product *= ++n;
	}
	return 'None';
}
